## BioDetect APP

Welcome to the BioDetect, a web app that allows users to detect organisms based on images they provide. This API leverages cutting-edge technology to analyze images and provide detailed information about the detected organisms, including species, common name, scientific name, classification, physical characteristics, behavioral traits, habitat, geographic distribution, diet and feeding habits, reproduction and lifecycle, conservation status, interactions with other species, adaptations to the environment, threats and challenges, and conservation efforts and initiatives.

#### Detect
![detect]()

The Detect interface allows users to upload an image of an animal, insect, or plant for detection. Upon uploading an image, the API analyzes it and generates detailed information about the detected organism. The information is displayed in a carousel format, allowing users to click through each piece of information.
